## News and Updates
- **[Feb 12, 2025]** We just launched Guardrails Index -- the first of its kind benchmark comparing the performance and latency of 24 guardrails across 6 most common categories! Check out the index at index.guardrailsai.com

## What is Guardrails?

Guardrails is a Python framework that helps build reliable AI applications by performing two key functions:
1. Guardrails runs Input/Output Guards in your application that detect, quantify and mitigate the presence of specific types of risks. To look at the full suite of risks, check out [Guardrails Hub](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/).
2. Guardrails help you generate structured data from LLMs.

</div>


### Guardrails Hub

Guardrails Hub is a collection of pre-built measures of specific types of risks (called 'validators'). Multiple validators can be combined together into Input and Output Guards that intercept the inputs and outputs of LLMs. Visit [Guardrails Hub](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/) to see the full list of validators and their documentation.

## Installation

```python
pip install guardrails-ai
```


## Getting Started


### Create Input and Output Guards for LLM Validation

1. Download and configure the Guardrails Hub CLI.

    ```bash
    pip install guardrails-ai
    guardrails configure
    ```
2. Install a guardrail from Guardrails Hub.

    ```bash
    guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/regex_match
    ```
3. Create a Guard from the installed guardrail.

    ```python
    from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction
    from guardrails.hub import RegexMatch

    guard = Guard().use(
        RegexMatch, regex="\(?\d{3}\)?-? *\d{3}-? *-?\d{4}", on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION
    )

    guard.validate("123-456-7890")  # Guardrail passes

    try:
        guard.validate("1234-789-0000")  # Guardrail fails
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    ```
    Output:
    ```console
    Validation failed for field with errors: Result must match \(?\d{3}\)?-? *\d{3}-? *-?\d{4}
    ```
4. Run multiple guardrails within a Guard.
    First, install the necessary guardrails from Guardrails Hub.

    ```bash
    guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/competitor_check
    guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/toxic_language
    ```

    Then, create a Guard from the installed guardrails.

    ```python
    from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction
    from guardrails.hub import CompetitorCheck, ToxicLanguage

    guard = Guard().use_many(
        CompetitorCheck(["Apple", "Microsoft", "Google"], on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION),
        ToxicLanguage(threshold=0.5, validation_method="sentence", on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION)
    )

    guard.validate(
        """An apple a day keeps a doctor away.
        This is good advice for keeping your health."""
    )  # Both the guardrails pass

    try:
        guard.validate(
            """Shut the hell up! Apple just released a new iPhone."""
        )  # Both the guardrails fail
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    ```
    Output:
    ```console
    Validation failed for field with errors: Found the following competitors: [['Apple']]. Please avoid naming those competitors next time, The following sentences in your response were found to be toxic:

    - Shut the hell up!
    ```

### Use Guardrails to generate structured data from LLMs


Let's go through an example where we ask an LLM to generate fake pet names. To do this, we'll create a Pydantic [BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/) that represents the structure of the output we want.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Pet(BaseModel):
    pet_type: str = Field(description="Species of pet")
    name: str = Field(description="a unique pet name")
```

Now, create a Guard from the `Pet` class. The Guard can be used to call the LLM in a manner so that the output is formatted to the `Pet` class. Under the hood, this is done by either of two methods:
1. Function calling: For LLMs that support function calling, we generate structured data using the function call syntax.
2. Prompt optimization: For LLMs that don't support function calling, we add the schema of the expected output to the prompt so that the LLM can generate structured data.

```py
from guardrails import Guard
import openai

prompt = """
    What kind of pet should I get and what should I name it?

    ${gr.complete_json_suffix_v2}
"""
guard = Guard.for_pydantic(output_class=Pet, prompt=prompt)

raw_output, validated_output, *rest = guard(
    llm_api=openai.completions.create,
    engine="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct"
)

print(validated_output)
```

This prints:
```
{
    "pet_type": "dog",
    "name": "Buddy
}
```

### Guardrails Server

Guardrails can be set up as a standalone service served by Flask with `guardrails start`, allowing you to interact with it via a REST API. This approach simplifies development and deployment of Guardrails-powered applications.

1. Install: `pip install "guardrails-ai"`
2. Configure: `guardrails configure`
3. Create a config: `guardrails create --validators=hub://guardrails/two_words --guard-name=two-word-guard`
4. Start the dev server: `guardrails start --config=./config.py`
5. Interact with the dev server via the snippets below
```
# with the guardrails client
import guardrails as gr

gr.settings.use_server = True
guard = gr.Guard(name='two-word-guard')
guard.validate('this is more than two words')

# or with the openai sdk
import openai
openai.base_url = "http://localhost:8000/guards/two-word-guard/openai/v1/"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "youropenaikey"

messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "tell me about an apple with 3 words exactly",
        },
    ]

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=messages,
)
```

For production deployments, we recommend using Docker with Gunicorn as the WSGI server for improved performance and scalability.
