I was given the following JSON response, which had problems due to incorrect values.

{
  "name": "Inception",
  "director": "Christopher Nolan"
}

Help me correct the incorrect values based on the given error messages.


Error Messages:
"JSON does not match schema:\n{\n  \"$\": [\n    \"'release_year' is a required property\"\n  ]\n}"



Given below is a JSON Schema that describes the output structure you should return.

{"properties": {"name": {"description": "The name of the movie.", "title": "Name", "type": "string"}, "director": {"description": "The name of the director.", "title": "Director", "type": "string"}, "release_year": {"description": "The year the movie was released.", "title": "Release Year", "type": "integer"}}, "uniqueItems": false, "required": ["name", "director", "release_year"], "type": "object", "title": "Movie", "deprecated": false, "readOnly": false, "writeOnly": false}

ONLY return a valid JSON object (no other text is necessary), where the key of the field in the JSON is the key of the entries within the schema's `properties`, and the value is of the type specified by the `type` property under that key. 
The JSON MUST conform to the structure described by the JSON Schema provided BUT SHOULD NOT BE A JSON Schema ITSELF.
Be sure to include any types and format requests e.g. requests for lists, objects and specific types. 
Be correct and concise. 
If you are unsure anywhere, enter `null`.

Here's an example of the structure:
{
  "name": "Star Wars",
  "director": "George Lucas",
  "release_year": 1977
}
