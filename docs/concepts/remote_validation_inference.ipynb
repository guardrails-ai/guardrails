    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concept, [guardrailing](https://www.guardrailsai.com/docs/concepts/guard) has a few areas that, when unoptimized, can introduce latency and be extremely resource-expensive. The main two areas are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Guardrailing orchestration; and\n",
    "* ML models that validate a single guard\n",
    "\n",
    "These are resource-heavy in slightly different ways. ML models can run with low latency on GPU-equipped machines. (Some ML models used for validation run in tens of seconds on CPUs, while they run in milliseconds on GPUs.) Meanwhile, guardrailing orchestration benefits from general memory and compute resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Guardrails approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The Guardrails library tackles this problem by providing an interface that allows users to separate the execution of orchestration from the execution of ML-based validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of this solution is a simple upgrade to validator libraries themselves. Instead of *always* downloading and installing ML models, you can configure them to call a remote endpoint. This remote endpoint hosts the ML model behind an API that presents a unified interface for all validator models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails hosts some of these for free as a preview feature. Users can host their own models by following the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::note\n",
    "Remote validation inferencing is only available in Guardrails versions 0.5.0 and above.\n",
