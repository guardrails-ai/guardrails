    "## The Need\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concept, guardrailing has a few areas which, when unoptimized, can be extremely latency and resource expensive to run. The main two areas are in guardrailing orchestration and in the ML models used for validating a single guard. These two are resource heavy in slightly different ways. ML models can run with really low latency on GPU-equipped machines, while guardrailing orchestration benefits from general memory and compute resources. Some ML models used for validation run in tens of seconds on CPUs, while they run in milliseconds on GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Guardrails approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The Guardrails library tackles this problem by providing an interface that allows users to separate the execution of orchestraion from the exeuction of ML-based validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of this solution is a simple upgrade to validator libraries themselves. Instead of *always* downloading and installing ML models, they can be configured to reach out to a remote endpoint. This remote endpoint hosts the ML model behind an API that has a uninfied interface for all validator models. Guardrails hosts some of these as a preview feature for free, and users can host their own models as well by following the same interface.\n",
